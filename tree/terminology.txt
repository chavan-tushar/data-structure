# Terminology:
# Full Tree- A full tree is a tree in which every node points to either 2 nodes or no nonde.
# Perfect - A perfect tree is a tree in which all nodes at same level points to same number of childs. 
# Complete - A complete tree is a tree in which we fill the tree from left to right with no gaps in between
# Every Node can have only 1 parent
# Leaf - A node which doesnt have any child
# Binary Search Tree - A Binary Search Tree is a tree in which the child node which has a lesser value than parent node will always be placed on left side and the node which has a greater value will be placed on right side of a parent node. 
# When we add a new node to the binary search tree then we always start by comparing it with the parent node and then decide on which side the new node will be placed
# The most important part to note about binary search tree is when we look at any node, all the nodes which are on right side of binary tree, has a value greater than the current node and all the nodes which are on left side of the current node will have value less than the current node.
